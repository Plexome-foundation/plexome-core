# Plexome Core v2.0 🧠🌐

**Plexome** is a high-performance, decentralized AI swarm engine designed for autonomous continuous learning and distributed inference. It enables thousands of consumer-grade PCs to act as a single, collective intelligence.

## 🚀 The Vision: V2.0 Modular Architecture
The system has transitioned from a monolithic design to a **Modular Plugin Architecture**. This allows the network to update its core components (AI logic or Network stack) on-the-fly without restarting the node.

### Core Components:
* **plexome_host.exe (The Orchestrator):** A lightweight dispatcher that manages module lifecycles and routes tasks between blocks.
* **pxm_ai.dll (The Brain):** Multithreaded LLM engine based on `llama.cpp`. Optimized for Phi-3-mini with parallel context pooling and smart stop-token handling.
* **pxm_network.dll (The Senses):** Decentralized P2P stack using a custom Swarm protocol for real-time model synchronization and weight exchange.

## 🧠 Swarm Intelligence Features
* **Performance Tiers:** Nodes automatically categorize themselves as **Potato**, **Standard**, or **Titan** (Queen) based on hardware benchmarks.
* **Decentralized Federated Learning:** Nodes scan web data, generate 50MB LoRA adapters, and submit them for consensus-based merging.
* **Hallucination Protection:** The "Council of Queens" verifies training results through weight-vector similarity checks before committing to the global model.

🏗 Build Instructions
Plexome Core is built using CMake and requires a C++20 compliant compiler (MSVC 2022+ recommended for Windows).

1. Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive [https://github.com/Plexome-foundation/plexome-core](https://github.com/Plexome-foundation/plexome-core)
2. Build the system
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
3. Run the node
As a Seed: plexome_host.exe --seed

As a Peer: plexome_host.exe

🗺 Roadmap
[x] Transition to Modular DLL Architecture.

[ ] Phase 3: Implement automated Hardware Benchmarking ("The Parrot Meter").

[ ] Phase 4: Develop the Distributed Web-Scanner for automated knowledge injection.

[ ] Phase 5: Peer-to-peer LoRA weight aggregation and consensus engine.

Developed by Architect and the AI Swarm Community. Built for the era of autonomous intelligence.
